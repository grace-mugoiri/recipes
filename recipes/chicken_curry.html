    <ol>
        <li>After washing your chicken, bring it boil for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop off the white onions into very small pieces and in a pan of
            hot oil add them.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the capsicums and blend them. Crash ginger and garlic into a thick paste.
            Finely chop the carrots into small cubes.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger paste into the onions and let that fry for a minute. 
            Be careful not to burn that as garlic burns easily. </li>
